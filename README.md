## UNMS versions

UNMS is in beta. It means that there isn't any [LTS version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) and we are not testing [RC versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) for longer period of time because we prefer quicker development. Stable versions will be available since integration with [UCRM](https://ucrm.ubnt.com).
